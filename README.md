#  NIFTY 50 OHLC Dashboard Project (Daily, 5-Minute, 25-Minute)

This project presents a **multi-timeframe analysis** of NIFTY 50 stock market data using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**. It showcases technical indicators like RSI, MACD, SMA, and Bollinger Bands — all brought together into interactive dashboards for **daily**, **5-minute**, and **25-minute** intervals.

##  Python Script – Financial Calculations

All indicator logic is written in:

- `OHLC_financial_metrics__code.py` - computes Total Return,Sharp Ratio,Max Drawdown
- Output CSVs:
  - `calculated_financial_metrics_master_day.csv`
  - `calculated_financial_metrics_master_5min.csv`
  - `calculated_financial_metrics_master_25min.csv`

 Additional cleaned and zipped outputs:

- `OHLC_indicators_code.py` – computes MACD, RSI, drawdown, return, Bollinger Bands, etc.  
- Outputs:
- `master_day_macd_rsi_bb_output.zip`  
- `master_5min_macd_rsi_bb_clean.zip`  
- `master_25min_macd_rsi_bb_clean.csv`

>  To generate output for different timeframes (5-min or 25-min), change the  name from master_day to respective 5min & 25min in code.

---

##  SQL Queries – Data Preparation

All preprocessing is done via:
- `OHLC_queries.sql`

--- Computes:
- SMA values  
- Monthly volatility  
- Price gaps  
- Streak and trend logic
- Consecutive Up/Down Days

 **To switch from day to 5min or 25min**, just change the  name from master_day to respective 5min & 25min in query.

###  Dataset Coverage:
- Timeframes: **Daily, 5min, 25min**
- Parameters: **Open, High, Low, Close, Volume**
- Derived indicators: **MACD, RSI, SMA (20/50), Bollinger Bands**, Volatility, Price Gaps

###  Key Observations (Daily Example-(Day)):
-  **Total Return**: +190.19%, **Sharp Ratio**: 0.72 → Indicates decent long-term risk-adjusted performance  
-  **Max Drawdown**: –38.44% → Risk exposure during market dips  
-  **Price Gaps & Volatility**: High gap activity and volatility in March 2020 (COVID crash)  
-  **MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands**: Show trend shifts, overbought/oversold zones, and breakout setups

---

###  What This Dashboard Helps With:
-  Quickly identify bullish/bearish trends and momentum shifts  
-  Spot volatile periods and manage portfolio risk  
-  Compare trading behavior across timeframes  
-  Useful for investors (daily) and intraday traders (5min/25min)
